# "Starry Night" Ontology

The project's goal was to develop an ontology for Vincent Van Gogh's renowned artwork "Starry Night" by examining two articles authored by art critics. An ontology serves as a structured portrayal of the ideas and connections found in a specific field, in this instance, the "Starry Night" painting.

The project commenced by identifying the key concepts and connections that the art critics presented in their articles. This involved carefully analyzing the texts to extract relevant information and identify commonalities in how the critics discussed the painting.

After determining the essential concepts and relationships, they were structured into a formal ontology. The ontology was intended to capture the structure and meaning of the critics' analysis of the painting, encompassing the various components of the painting and how they interrelate.
